	sources ready to build.  Here you need to do anything necessary to get
	the sources patched and setup like they need to be setup to do a
	<b class="COMMAND">make</b>.
      </a></p><p><a name="PREP">	One thing to note:  Each of these sections is really just a place to
	execute shell scripts.  You could simply make an
	<span class="SYSTEMITEM">sh</span> script and put it after the
	<em>%prep</em> tag to unpack and patch your sources.
	We have made macros to aid in this, however.
      </a></p><p><a name="PREP">	The first of these macros is the <em>%setup</em>
	macro.  In its simplest form (no command line options), it simply
	unpacks the sources and <b class="COMMAND">cd</b>'s into the source
	directory.  It also takes the following options:
      </a></p><p></p><ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-n name</i></tt> will set the name of
	    the build directory to the listed <em>name</em>.  The
	    default is <em>$NAME-$VERSION</em>.  Other
	    possibilities include <em>$NAME</em>,
	    <em>${NAME}${VERSION}</em>, or whatever
	    the main tar file uses.  (Please note that these "$"
	    variables are <em>not</em> real variables available
	    within the spec file.  They are really just used here in place of a
	    sample name.  You need to use the real name and version in your
	    package, not a variable.)
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-c</i></tt> will create and cd to the

	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-b #</i></tt> will untar Source#
	    <em>before</em> <b class="COMMAND">cd</b>'ing into the
	    directory (and this makes no sense with <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-c</i></tt> so don't do it).  This is only useful
	    with multiple source files.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-a #</i></tt> will untar Source#
	    <em>after</em> cd'ing into the directory.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-T</i></tt> This option overrides the
	    default action of untarring the Source and requires a <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-b 0</i></tt> or <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-a
	    0</i></tt> to get the main source file untarred.  You need this
	    when there are secondary sources.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-D</i></tt> Do <em>not</em>
	    delete the directory before unpacking.  This is only useful where
	    you have more than one setup macro.  It should
	    <em>only</em> be used in setup macros
	    <em>after</em> the first one (but never in the first
	    one).
	  </a></p></li></ul><p><a name="PREP">	The next of the available macros is the <em>%patch</em>
	macro.  This macro helps automate the process of applying patches to the
	sources.  It takes several options, listed below:
      </a></p><p></p><ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <em>#</em> will apply Patch# as the patch file.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-p #</i></tt> specifies the number
	    of directories to strip for the patch(1) command.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-P</i></tt> The default action is to
	    apply <b class="COMMAND">Patch</b> (or <b class="COMMAND">Patch0</b>).  This
	    flag inhibits the default action and will require a <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>0</i></tt> to get the main source file untarred.
	    This option is useful in a second (or later)
	    <b class="COMMAND">%patch</b> macro that required a different
	    number than the first macro.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP"> You can also do <b class="COMMAND">%patch#</b> instead
	    of doing the real command: <b class="COMMAND">%patch # -P</b>
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="PREP">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>-b extension</i></tt> will save
	    originals as <tt class="FILENAME">filename.extension</tt> before
	    patching.
	  </a></p></li></ul><p><a name="PREP">	That should be all the macros you need.  After you have those right, you
	can also do any other setup you need to do via
	<span class="SYSTEMITEM">sh</span> type scripting.  Anything you include up
	until the <em>%build</em> macro (discussed in the
	next section) is executed via <span class="SYSTEMITEM">sh</span>.  Look at the
	example above for the types of things you might want to do here.
      </a></p></div><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="BUILD-SPEC">6.4. Build</a></h2><p><a name="BUILD-SPEC">	There aren't really any macros for this section.  You should just put
	any commands here that you would need to use to build the software once
	you had untarred the source, patched it, and cd'ed into the directory.
	This is just another set of commands passed to

	you are using values appropriate for your system (in most cases you
	are).  Or simply don't use this variable in your spec file.  It is
	optional.
      </a></p></div><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="INSTALL">6.5. Install</a></h2><p><a name="INSTALL">	There aren't really any macros here, either.  You basically just want to
	put whatever commands here that are necessary to install.  If you have
	<b class="COMMAND">make install</b> available to you in the package you are
	building, put that here.  If not, you can either patch the makefile for
	a <b class="COMMAND">make install</b> and just do a <b class="COMMAND">make
	install</b> here, or you can hand install them here with
	<span class="SYSTEMITEM">sh</span> commands.  You can consider your current
	directory to be the toplevel of the source directory.
	</a></p><p><a name="INSTALL">	The variable <tt class="VARNAME">RPM_BUILD_ROOT</tt> is available to tell you
	the path set as the <em>Buildroot:</em> in the header.
	Using build roots are optional but are highly recommended because they
	keep you from cluttering your system with software that isn't in your
	RPM database (building an RPM doesn't touch your database...you must go
	install the binary RPM you just built to do that).
      </a></p></div><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="CLEANING">6.6. Cleaning your system</a></h2><p><a name="CLEANING">	It's a good idea to always make sure there is a clean build root before
	building a package a second time on a system.  The
	<em>%clean</em> macro will help with that.  Simply
	put the proper commands there to blow away a former build root.  Anal,
	err, careful folks may want to test that
	<tt class="VARNAME">RPM_BUILD_ROOT</tt> wasn't set to
	<span class="SYSTEMITEM">/</span> before doing something this volatile.

	and uninstallation of binary packages.  A main reason for this is to do
	things like run <b class="COMMAND">ldconfig</b> after installing or

	the scripts is as follows:
      </a></p><p></p><ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="SCRIPTS">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">%pre</span> is the macro to do pre-install

      </a></p></div><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="FILES">6.8. Files</a></h2><p><a name="FILES">	This is the section where you <em>must</em> list the files
	for the binary package.  RPM has no way to know what binaries get
	installed as a result of <b class="COMMAND">make install</b>.  There is
	<em>NO</em> way to do this.  Some have suggested doing a
	<b class="COMMAND">find</b> before and after the package install.  With a
	multiuser system, this is unacceptable as other files may be created
	during a package building process that have nothing to do with the
	package itself.
      </a></p><p><a name="FILES">	There are some macros available to do some special things as well.  They
	are listed and described here:
      </a></p><p></p><ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="FILES">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">%doc</span> is used to mark documentation
	    in the source package that you want installed in a binary install.
	    The documents will be installed in
	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">/usr/doc/$NAME-$VERSION-$RELEASE</span>.
	    You can list multiple documents on the command line with this macro,
	    or you can list them all separately using a macro for each of them.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="FILES">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">%config</span> is used to mark
	    configuration files in a package.  This includes files like
	    sendmail.cf, passwd, etc.  If you later uninstall a package
	    containing config files, any unchanged files will be removed and any
	    changed files will get moved to their old name with a
	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">.rpmsave</span> appended to the filename.  You can
	    list multiple files with this macro as well.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="FILES">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">%dir</span> marks a single directory in a
	    file list to be included as being owned by a package.  By default,
	    if you list a directory name <em>WITHOUT</em> a
	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">%dir</span> macro,
	    <em>EVERYTHING</em> in that directory is included in the
	    file list and later installed as part of that package.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="FILES">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">%defattr</span> allows you to set default
	    attributes for files listed after the defattr declaration.  The
	    attributes are listed in the form <em>(mode, owner,
	    group)</em> where the mode is the octal number representing
	    the bit pattern for the new permissions (like
	    <b class="COMMAND">chmod</b> would use), owner is the username of the
	    owner, and group is the group you would like assigned.  You may
	    leave any field to the installed default by simply placing a
	    <em>-</em> in its place, as was done in the mode field
	    for the example package.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="FILES">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">%files -f &lt;filename&gt;</span> will
	    allow you to list your files in some arbitrary file within the build
	    directory of the sources.  This is nice in cases where you have a
	    package that can build it's own filelist.  You then just include
	    that filelist here and you don't have to specifically list the
	    files.
	  </a></p></li></ul><p><a name="FILES">	The <em>biggest caveat</em> in the file list is listing
	directories.  If you list <span class="SYSTEMITEM">/usr/bin</span> by accident,
