Building It</a></h1><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="SOURCE-TREE">7.1. The Source Directory Tree</a></h2><p><a name="SOURCE-TREE">	The first thing you need is a properly configured build tree.  This is
	configurable using the <span class="SYSTEMITEM">/etc/rpmrc</span> file.  Most
	people will just use <span class="SYSTEMITEM">/usr/src</span>.
      </a></p><p><a name="SOURCE-TREE">	You may need to create the following directories to make a build
	tree:
      </a></p><p></p><ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="SOURCE-TREE">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">BUILD</span> is the directory where all building
	    occurs by RPM.  You don't have to do your test building anywhere in
	    particular, but this is where RPM will do it's building.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="SOURCE-TREE">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">SOURCES</span> is the directory where you should
	    put your original source tar files and your patches.  This is where
	    RPM will look by default.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="SOURCE-TREE">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">SPECS</span> is the directory where all spec files
	    should go.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="SOURCE-TREE">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">RPMS</span> is where RPM will put all binary RPMs
	    when built.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="SOURCE-TREE">	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">SRPMS</span> is where all source RPMs will be put.
	  </a></p></li></ul></div><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="TEST-BUILD">7.2. Test Building</a></h2><p><a name="TEST-BUILD">	The first thing you'll probably want to to is get the source to build
	cleanly without using RPM.  To do this, unpack the sources, and change
	the directory name to $NAME.orig.  Then unpack the source again.
	Use this source to build from.  Go into the source directory and follow
	the instructions to build it.  If you have to edit things, you'll need a
	patch.  Once you get it to build, clean the source directory.  Make sure
	and remove any files that get made from a <b class="COMMAND">configure</b>
	script.  Then <b class="COMMAND">cd</b> back out of the source directory to
	its parent.  Then you'll do something like:
      </a></p><table width="100%" border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">diff -uNr dirname.orig dirname &gt; ../SOURCES/dirname-linux.patch
      </pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><p><a name="TEST-BUILD">	This will create a patch for you that you can use in your spec file.
	Note that the "linux" that you see in the patch name is just an
	identifier.  You might want to use something more descriptive like
	"config" or "bugs" to describe <em>why</em> you had to
	make a patch.  It's also a good idea to look at the patch file you are
	creating before using it to make sure no binaries were included by
	accident.
      </a></p></div><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="GENERATE-FILE">7.3. Generating the File List</a></h2><p><a name="GENERATE-FILE">	Now that you have source that will build and you know how to do it,
	build it and install it.  Look at the output of the install sequence and
	build your file list from that to use in the spec file.  We usually
	build the spec file in parallel with all of these steps.  You can create
	the initial one and fill in the easy parts, and then fill in the other
	steps as you go.
      </a></p></div><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="BUILD-PKG">7.4. Building the Package with RPM</a></h2><p><a name="BUILD-PKG">	Once you have a spec file, you are ready to try and build your
	package.  The most useful way to do it is with a command like the
	following:
      </a></p><table width="100%" border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">rpm -ba foobar-1.0.spec

      </a></p><p></p><ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="BUILD-PKG">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>p</i></tt> means just run the
	    <span class="SYSTEMITEM">prep</span> section of the specfile.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="BUILD-PKG">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>l</i></tt> is a list check that does

	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="BUILD-PKG">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>c</i></tt> do a prep and compile.  This
	    is useful when you are unsure of whether your source will build at
	    all.  It seems useless because you might want to just keep playing
	    with the source itself until it builds and then start using RPM, but
	    once you become accustomed to using RPM you will find instances when
	    you will use it.
	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="BUILD-PKG">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>i</i></tt>do a prep, compile, and

	  </a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p><a name="BUILD-PKG">	    <tt class="PARAMETER"><i>--test</i></tt> does not execute any

	it.  The easiest and best way is to use a totally different machine from
	the one you are building on to test.  After all, you've just done a lot
	of <b class="COMMAND">make install</b>'s on your own machine, so it should
	be installed fairly well.
      </a></p><p><a name="TESTING-IT">	You can do an <b class="COMMAND">rpm -e packagename</b> on the package to
	test, but that can be deceiving because in building the package, you did
	a <b class="COMMAND">make install</b>.  If you left something out of your
	file list, it will not get uninstalled.  You'll then reinstall the
	binary package and your system will be complete again, but your rpm
	still isn't.  Make sure and keep in mind that just because you do a
	<b class="COMMAND">rpm -ba package</b>, most people installing your package
	will just be doing the <b class="COMMAND">rpm -i package</b>.  Make sure you
	don't do anything in the <span class="SYSTEMITEM">build</span> or
	<span class="SYSTEMITEM">install</span> sections that will need to be done when
	the binaries are installed by themselves.
