<li><b>Plot outline</b>: Peter Parker gets bitten by a genetically-mutated spider during a class visit to Osborn Industries. The spider was part of the scientific experimentation there. The spider had been injected with a formula that Norman himself had created called OZ. Kong, one of Peter's classmates kills the spider before anyone could retrieve it. Norman Osborn decides to track Peter's progress. After several instances of fainting and displaying extraordinary strength and reflexes, Peter realizes the bite gave him spider-like powers. On one occasion, Peter accidentally breaks his bully, Flash Thompson's, hand. When Flash's family attempt to sue, Peter becomes part of a local wrestling circuit as the masked "Amazing Spider-Man" to anonymously pay for his Aunt May and Uncle Ben's legal fees. Peter also gets his Spider-Man suit courtesy of the wrestling organization. Peter does not reveal this secret double-life to anybody, not even his crush Mary Jane Watson and friend Harry Osborn. Peter flees the wrestling organization after being accused of stealing. Angry and tired, he allows a burglar to escape after robbing a deli owner. Peter returns home where his aunt and uncle berate him for his failing academic grades. Ben informs Peter of the "with great power, comes great responsibility" ethos that Peter's father abided by. Peter is angered that his father was never there to tell him that himself, and runs off to contemplate Ben's words, but upon returning home, he finds that Uncle Ben had been murdered. Peter tracks down Ben's killer, subdues him, only to find out he is the same burglar he had let get away earlier. He ties him to a rope and leaves the killer to the police. Understanding Uncle Ben's words, Peter is galvanized to using his powers for good, and therefore making Spider-Man a superhero. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn injects himself with the OZ formula, gaining confidence by tracking the effects the spider formula had on Peter. As a result, Norman is transformed into a monstrous, fiery, large <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_versions_of_the_Green_Goblin" title="Alternative versions of the Green Goblin">goblin</a>. The Goblin destroys the lab, kills several scientists and leaves Dr. Otto Octavius, another scientist, for dead. All this is seen by Harry Osborn who runs home to find his mother dead and his house in flames, noticing his father's goblin form leaving the scene. Peter, having now invented web-shooters for his alter-ego, Spider-Man, goes back to school to find the Goblin destroying it. After a small skirmish in the school, Spider-Man leads the Goblin to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge" title="Brooklyn Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>, where the NYPD confront him. The Goblin is shot off the bridge, falling into the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River" title="East River">East River</a>, assumed dead.

Jonah Jameson, who gives him the minimum pay. Peter then fixes an internet problem which encourages Jameson to offer Peter a part-time job as a computer technician. Peter uses the Bugle's website to locate who the criminal that shot uncle Ben had been working for. He finds that he is part of a larger criminal organization that is led by Wilson Fisk, The Kingpin. He then finds a criminal group called the Enforcers who also work for the Kingpin. Spider-Man tracks and defeats the Enforcers which forces Mr. Big to tell Spider-Man about Fisk's important gala the next night. The FBI interrupt and Spider-Man barely manages to escape. The next day, Mary Jane asks Peter on a Friday date. Peter moves it to Saturday instead. That Friday, Spider-Man goes to Fisk's penthouse but trips the alarm and is overpowered by Fisk and subdued by Electro. Spider-Man is then unmasked by Fisk who, realising Spider-Man is just a boy, throws Peter's unconscious form through a window but opts to keep Spider-Man's mask. Peter survives the fall but is badly injured, cancelling Mary-Jane's date, who becomes angered by this. Later, Fisk murders Mr. Big after discovering he had sold him out to Spider-Man. Fisk pulls Spider-Man's mask over Mr. Big and crushes his skull. The body is discovered and the news report that Spider-Man is a murder suspect. At school, Peter creates a false e-mail and through it, discovers Fisk's security system has CCTV footage on CDs. Spider-Man quickly invades the penthouse again and bags as many CDs as possible. After a skirmish with the Enforcers, Electro and Fisk, Spider-Man escapes victorious and gives the CDs (apart from his unmasking) to Ben Urich, a reporter for the Daily Bugle. The published story forces Fisk to leave the country. Peter then reveals to Mary Jane that he is Spider-Man.</li>

<li><b>Plot outline</b>: Mary Jane urges Peter to break up with Kitty, who is revealed to be their new class-mate. At lunch, Peter apologises to Kitty but she calls Peter her worst mistake. Spider-Man meets Daredevil, Shang-Chi, Moon Knight, Doctor Strange and Iron Fist on the rooftop and agrees to be part of the "Ultimate Knights" group but stresses they should not kill Kingpin but ruin him legitimately. Iron Fist tells Fisk about the group's plans in order to protect his family, who Fisk has threatened. Moon Knight creates the Ronin persona and poses as Fisk's bodyguard. This persona becomes dominant and attacks Midtown High School, incapacitates Kitty and knocks out Spider-Man, taking him to Fisk. Fisk concedes Spider-Man is only kept alive because Fisk owes Spider-Man's licensing rights. Fisk lies that Daredevil works for him and beats Ronin to the brink of death, knowing he is Moon Knight. Spider-Man interrupts an Ultimate Knights meeting and accuses Daredevil of being an informer. However, Daredevil refutes this as his heightened senses pin-points Iron Fist as the informer, which he admits. Iron Fist is used to distract Fisk at a later meeting. When Fisk realizes this, he runs to Vanessa's room, only to find an enraged Daredevil, who is holding the comatose Vanessa by her neck, threatening to snap her neck in revenge for what Fisk has done. Spider-Man arrives in time, and pleads and persuades Daredevil to spare Vanessa's life. Daredevil argues that if he doesn't, Fisk will kill the people he cares for, and that it's the only thing that will get Fisk to stand down. Spider-Man agrees, but convinces him not to kill Vanessa, as she is innocent. Daredevil finally relents, but wants Fisk to give up and confess his crimes. Spider-Man, however, reasons that Fisk won't do that, as he would manipulate the law to avoid imprisonment. So Daredevil forces him to take Vanessa and leave the country, permanently. However, Fisk is unwilling to admit defeat and orders the heroes' deaths, and for Midtown High to be blown up while Peter is at school. While attempting to assassinate Moon Knight, Fisk's men seemingly succeed, but Ronin manages to survive through his alter-egos and hands himself in, confessing Fisk ordered the hit.

They set out to also find the real Peter Parker before it is too late.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> The Human Torch and Iceman corner Spider-Man while he is trying to steal money from an armored car. After failing to convince the heroes that he is the real Peter, they attack him, and the Chameleon pulls out a gun. With no avail, the Chameleon shoots them with what appears to be an electric shock, and escapes. The two heroes chase him. Meanwhile, the female Chameleon tells Peter that she could have the fake Peter hurt Aunt May and everyone he loves, to which Peter screams at her and tries to break free. Suddenly, the Chameleon bursts in, and the two heroes arrive in time to freeze them in ice blocks and set Peter free. Afterward, Peter arrives home, with his life totally wrecked, the Chameleon twins are behind bars at S.H.I.E.L.D., and J. Jonah Jameson lies in a hospital bed, mumbling "Parker" to himself, revealing that he knows Peter is Spider-Man.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></li>

She says that he has suffered enough. At home, Aunt May says that he should take some time off and talk to Gwen. She says that he should not punish himself, as he has been punished enough. At school, Gwen walks over to Mary Jane, who is in the library. She begins to cry, and Mary Jane lets her sit down. Gwen comes clean and says she forced Peter to be her boyfriend, and that she knew Mary Jane loved him. She says that Mary Jane is the perfect girl for him, because she can understand his life as a superhero. She says that they are done, because they have proof that if Peter loved Mary Jane she would love him back. She then storms off. At the hospital, J. Jonah Jameson reveals that he knows who Spider-Man is, but he won't tell. Ben Urich and Robbie Robertson say he should, but Jameson says he swears he will protect his identity forever. Back in Peter's classroom, Lana Baumgartner is transferred into his class, and Peter finds out that she is the daughter of the Bombshells.

<li><b>Plot outline</b>: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Green_Goblin" class="mw-redirect" title="Ultimate Green Goblin">Norman Osborn</a>, who was thought dead, turns out to be alive, and in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody. Despite their belief that Osborn no longer had powers, he is still able to transform into his Goblin form, and escape his cell. He then breaks several of Spider-Man's other villains out of their cells: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Octopus#Ultimate_Doctor_Octopus" title="Doctor Octopus">Doctor Octopus</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_%28Marvel_Comics%29#Ultimate_Electro" title="Electro (Marvel Comics)">Electro</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Sandman" class="mw-redirect" title="Ultimate Sandman">Sandman</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraven_the_Hunter#Ultimate_Marvel" title="Kraven the Hunter">Kraven the Hunter</a>, and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_%28Marvel_Comics%29" title="Vulture (Marvel Comics)">Vulture</a>. Calling them "Men of God", Osborn is then able to lead them to freedom. They are then able to make it into New York City, and hide out in a building. Though no one saw where they hid, there are several witnesses to their arrival in the city, one of which was Ben Urich of the <i>Daily Bugle</i>. Meanwhile, Spider-Man heads into the conflict between the New Ultimates and the Avengers (as seen in "<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Comics:_Avengers" title="Ultimate Comics: Avengers">Avengers Vs. New Ultimates</a>"). While observing the event from a distance, he gets a call from MJ. She tells him that she just found out, through the <i>Daily Bugle</i>s website, that Norman Osborn is alive, and has escaped with some of Spider-Man's other enemies. She warns him that Osborn is going to kill him, and he should go back home to protect his family. Peter phones home and tells Aunt May and Gwen to go into hiding. Peter goes into New York as Spider-Man and sees Doctor Octopus's body, who's dead after refusing to take revenge on Peter, and sees The Punisher pointing a gun at Captain America. Spider-Man leaps and pushes Captain America out of the way, taking the bullet in the stomach. Meanwhile, Vulture and the other villains crash the Tinkerers hideout and force him to give them weapons.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Kraven then tracks Peters' scent to his house, where the villains encounter <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Iceman" class="mw-redirect" title="Ultimate Iceman">Bobby Drake</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_versions_of_the_Human_Torch#Ultimate_Marvel" title="Alternative versions of the Human Torch">Johnny Storm</a>. After a brief battle, an injured Spider-Man arrives, the bullet wound in his stomach webbed over and having lost his mask. After quickly dispatching Vulture he challenges the other villains to attack him.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> The battle soon draws the attention of the entire neighbourhood, who soon surround the area, glimpsing Peter without his mask and deducing his identity. Some begin filming the battle on their mobile phones. Peter is bombarded by assaults from the Vulture, Sandman, and Electro, but before Electro can finish off Peter, he is shot in the chest by a returning May Parker. The bullet wound causes Electro to unleash an electrical barrage that neutralises Vulture and Sandman. The battle appears to be over until Norman Osborn awakens, lunging straight for Peter, Aunt May, and Gwen Stacy. Peter grabs them both and jumps to safety with the Green Goblin following quickly behind. Peter frantically instructs Gwen to not listen to anything Aunt May says and to get her as far away from the battle as possible. Meanwhile, Mary Jane is at home watching the news and trying to get in touch with Peter on the phone. When she sees the sparks in the sky coming from Peter's neighborhood, she tries to leave the house but is stopped by her mother. Meanwhile, Peter fights against the Green Goblin but realizes he is too weak to win the fight alone. Peter wakes up a sleeping Johnny Storm from the front lawn, who leaps into battle with Osborn and tries to burn him. Norman, however, absorbs the entirety of Johnny's attack, sending Johnny back down to the Parkers' front lawn. Desperate and faced with a super-powered Goblin, Peter begins to mercilessly beat Osborn with a mail box while verbally berating him, asking what the point of killing Spider-Man would be. Peter quips that killing him won't bring back Harry, nor will it restore his industrial empire, while throwing him into an open fire hydrant. Osborn's response is, "But you'll be dead." Peter, seemingly resigned to dying, clenches his side as the Goblin bears down on him, when suddenly a speeding (stolen) van driven by Mary Jane hits the Goblin, momentarily incapacitating him. Peter punches through the windshield to rescue Mary Jane, kisses her, and throws her to safety in a web that he spins. Osborn tries to crawl out from under the van, angry and vowing to destroy Peter's life and family like Spider-Man destroyed his. Peter, completely exhausted, lifts up the van and slams it repeatedly down on Norman. Suddenly the van explodes, throwing  Peter at the feet of Johnny Storm and his neighbors. Johnny remarks that he thinks Peter got Osborn in the explosion. MJ, Gwen and Aunt May all show up simultaneously. Aunt May begins to cry while MJ and Gwen ask where the ambulances are. Peter, in his last breath, says to Aunt May "It's okay... I did it. Don't you see... it's okay. I did it. I couldn't save him. Uncle Ben. I couldn't save him... no matter what I did. But I saved you. I did it. I did..." He smiles up at her, then his eyes gloss over. Johnny checks for a pulse as the rest of the Parker family looks on in wide-eyed disbelief. His expression confirms their worst fears: Peter Parker is dead. Amid the screams of anguish and grief, we see the flaming body of a powered-down Osborn in the wreckage, whose expression goes from lifeless to a slight smile; suggesting he's still alive or happy that he managed to kill Peter Parker.</li>
