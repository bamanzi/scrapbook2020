<p>Written by: Scott Beatty, Chuck Dixon, Devin Grayson, Greg Rucka, Dennis O'Neil, John Ostrander, et al.<br>
Art by: various<br>
First Published: 1999</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After suffering a cataclysmic earthquake, the U.S. government deemed Gotham City uninhabitable. Months later, those that refused to vacate "No Man's Land" live amidst a citywide war. But with the return of the vigilante, Batman, and the appearance of an enigmatic new Batgirl, justice returns to Gotham.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>No Man's Land</em> was a year-long status quo that changed Gotham radically. These volumes collect a number of connected story arcs that follow the ragtag Gotham policemen and vigilantes as they attempt to maintain order in a city left for dead, as various villains attempt to exploit it. Notable developments include the debut of Cassandra Cain, who would later become Batgirl, and a character arc for Helena Bertinelli, the Huntress. The <em>Cataclysm</em> and <em>Road to No Man's Land</em> trades collect the lead-up to the event, and are optional reading, though they do add a lot of useful context.   </p>

<h3 id="wiki_batman.2C_by_grant_morrison">Batman, by Grant Morrison</h3>
<p>Written by: Grant Morrison<br>
Art by: Andy Kubert, J.H. Williams III, Tony Daniel, Frank Quitely, Yanick Paquette, Chris Burnham, et al.<br>
First Published: 2006  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Batman receives the shock of his life when he discovers that he has a son, Damian Wayne! Trained by the League of Assassins, this offspring of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul isn't just the deadliest 10 year-old in the world—he's also intensely focused on being Batman's new sidekick... no matter which Robin stands in his way.  </p>
<p>The troubled life of Bruce Wayne seems to spin out of control when his releationship with the mysterious Jezebel Jet deepens. Soon Bruce Wayne drops out completely, having seemingly become the victim of mental illness and abandoning his Batman identity for a life on the streets of Gotham City. Capitalizing on the fall of their greatest foe, the Club of Villains begin a crime spree through the streets of Gotham that threatens to bring the city to its knees.    </p>
<p>In Bruce Wayne's absence, Gotham City needs a new Batman. Dick Grayson takes up his former mentor's cape &amp; cowl...and trains Damian Wayne as his own Robin! This is a whole new kind of Dark Knight: but is he what the city needs? Or just what it deserves?  </p>
<p>Bruce Wayne publicly announces that he is the financial backer of Batman and establishes a worldwide franchise of Batmen that will protect the entire globe. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grant Morrison had touched on Batman multiple times in his 30+ year career in comics, from Gothic, to Arkham Asylum, to Batman's appearances in the 1990s JLA. But when he took over the Batman series in 2006, he set out to craft an epic that would build off the entire history of The Caped Crusader, stitching together one cohesive arc for the hero and his franchise from the beginnings of the Golden Age in 1939 to the modern day. Morrison's Batman was not just a caped crusader protecting Gotham; he was the product of all the the wild, weird and zany life experiences Batman had endured across all the various eras of comics history. Morrison united the disparate history of the character and wrote an epic that pushed the universe and the character forward, whilst strengthening and acknowledging all that come before. This is the tale where Batman meets his son, confronts his darkest failed mirrors, is threatened by the systemic destruction of Batman on a conceptual level, solves his final case, faces the god of depression and all evil and then is reborn for a new generation. This saga brings about some of the best versions of many Batfamily characters, including Dick Grayson, Damian Wayne, and Jason Todd.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a Gotham City turned upside down, Robin has become more than a single hero—Robin is a movement. With Bruce Wayne sidelined and the Batman co-opted by the police, a legion of teens are putting on the yellow “R” and following in the footsteps of their crime-fighting icons.</p>
<p>But all it takes is one tragic accident for everything to go wrong. And when it does, the crackdown on the Robins is swift and merciless. Now, all of the original Boy Wonders—Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake and Damian Wayne—are back in Gotham, determined to save the kids who have taken up their legacy.</p>
<p>This Robin War is not as spontaneous as it seems. From their shadowy lair, Gotham’s oldest and most powerful secret society is manipulating all sides of the conflict—and not even those who trained for years with the World’s Greatest Detective can guess the true purpose behind the Court of Owls’ intricate plan.</p>

###Batman: No Man's Land
Written by: Scott Beatty, Chuck Dixon, Devin Grayson, Greg Rucka, Dennis O'Neil, John Ostrander, et al.  
Art by: various  
First Published: 1999

&gt;After suffering a cataclysmic earthquake, the U.S. government deemed Gotham City uninhabitable. Months later, those that refused to vacate "No Man's Land" live amidst a citywide war. But with the return of the vigilante, Batman, and the appearance of an enigmatic new Batgirl, justice returns to Gotham.  

*No Man's Land* was a year-long status quo that changed Gotham radically. These volumes collect a number of connected story arcs that follow the ragtag Gotham policemen and vigilantes as they attempt to maintain order in a city left for dead, as various villains attempt to exploit it. Notable developments include the debut of Cassandra Cain, who would later become Batgirl, and a character arc for Helena Bertinelli, the Huntress. The *Cataclysm* and *Road to No Man's Land* trades collect the lead-up to the event, and are optional reading, though they do add a lot of useful context.

###Batman, by Grant Morrison  
Written by: Grant Morrison  
Art by: Andy Kubert, J.H. Williams III, Tony Daniel, Frank Quitely, Yanick Paquette, Chris Burnham, et al.  
First Published: 2006  

&gt; Batman receives the shock of his life when he discovers that he has a son, Damian Wayne! Trained by the League of Assassins, this offspring of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul isn't just the deadliest 10 year-old in the world—he's also intensely focused on being Batman's new sidekick... no matter which Robin stands in his way.  

&gt; The troubled life of Bruce Wayne seems to spin out of control when his releationship with the mysterious Jezebel Jet deepens. Soon Bruce Wayne drops out completely, having seemingly become the victim of mental illness and abandoning his Batman identity for a life on the streets of Gotham City. Capitalizing on the fall of their greatest foe, the Club of Villains begin a crime spree through the streets of Gotham that threatens to bring the city to its knees.    

&gt; In Bruce Wayne's absence, Gotham City needs a new Batman. Dick Grayson takes up his former mentor's cape &amp; cowl...and trains Damian Wayne as his own Robin! This is a whole new kind of Dark Knight: but is he what the city needs? Or just what it deserves?  

&gt; Bruce Wayne publicly announces that he is the financial backer of Batman and establishes a worldwide franchise of Batmen that will protect the entire globe. 


Grant Morrison had touched on Batman multiple times in his 30+ year career in comics, from Gothic, to Arkham Asylum, to Batman's appearances in the 1990s JLA. But when he took over the Batman series in 2006, he set out to craft an epic that would build off the entire history of The Caped Crusader, stitching together one cohesive arc for the hero and his franchise from the beginnings of the Golden Age in 1939 to the modern day. Morrison's Batman was not just a caped crusader protecting Gotham; he was the product of all the the wild, weird and zany life experiences Batman had endured across all the various eras of comics history. Morrison united the disparate history of the character and wrote an epic that pushed the universe and the character forward, whilst strengthening and acknowledging all that come before. This is the tale where Batman meets his son, confronts his darkest failed mirrors, is threatened by the systemic destruction of Batman on a conceptual level, solves his final case, faces the god of depression and all evil and then is reborn for a new generation. This saga brings about some of the best versions of many Batfamily characters, including Dick Grayson, Damian Wayne, and Jason Todd.

###Batman: Gates of Gotham  
Written by: Scott Snyder, Kyle Higgins  
Art by: Trevor McCarthy  
First Published: 2011  

&gt;At the turn of the century, three prominent families shaped the construction of modern-day Gotham City. Now, a madman with three-hundred pounds of explosives and a century-old grudge is threatening to bring it all crashing down. Beginning with the simultaneous destruction of some of Gotham's oldest bridges, the mysterious villain is targeting the holdings and legacies of Gotham's most notable families--including the Waynes. 

&gt;To uncover the truth behind the villainous Architect and his link to the city's violent past, Batman unites with Robin, Red Robin and Batman Inc.'s Hong Kong operative the Black Bat. But can they stop their new foe's plans before it's too late? The future of Gotham started with an explosion, and it could end the very same way...  

One of the final Batman stories of the Post-Crisis universe, *Gates of Gotham* sees the children of Batman (Dick Grayson, Cassandra Cain, Tim Drake, and Damian Waye) work together to unravel the sordid history of Gotham.

####**Gotham City Sirens**, by Paul Dini, et al.  

&gt;Catwoman, Poison Ivy, and Harley Quinn—they’re beautiful, they’re deadly, and for the first time in their lives, all three are trying to fly on the straight and narrow. Tired of playing by other people's rules, regardless of which side of the law they're on, these tough ladies have a new agenda that's all their own, and they'll use any means necessary to pursue it. 

&gt;Only, sometimes, friends can be more trouble than they're worth. Particularly when they're unaccustomed to things like loyalty… or sanity.

####**Robin War**, by Tom King

&gt; In a Gotham City turned upside down, Robin has become more than a single hero—Robin is a movement. With Bruce Wayne sidelined and the Batman co-opted by the police, a legion of teens are putting on the yellow “R” and following in the footsteps of their crime-fighting icons.
&gt; 
&gt; But all it takes is one tragic accident for everything to go wrong. And when it does, the crackdown on the Robins is swift and merciless. Now, all of the original Boy Wonders—Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake and Damian Wayne—are back in Gotham, determined to save the kids who have taken up their legacy.
&gt; 
&gt; This Robin War is not as spontaneous as it seems. From their shadowy lair, Gotham’s oldest and most powerful secret society is manipulating all sides of the conflict—and not even those who trained for years with the World’s Greatest Detective can guess the true purpose behind the Court of Owls’ intricate plan.
