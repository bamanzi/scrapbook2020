<h1>Introduction to QEMU</h1>

<h2>What's QEMU and why is it cool?</h2>

<p>QEMU is an open source emulator capable of running another operating
system in a window.  To see this in action, download a bootable cd image
(such as knoppix) and boot that cdrom under qemu by going
"qemu -cdrom filename.iso".</p>

<p>An even cooler ability of QEMU is that it's not limited to running x86 code,
but can run x86_64, Arm, Power PC, Mips, Sparc, and more.  This means you can
download the 
<a href="http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/ubuntu-releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-desktop-powerpc.iso">bootable Ubuntu image for Power PC</a> on
your x86 laptop and run it with "qemu-system-ppc -cdrom
ubuntu-6.10-desktop-powerpc.iso".  (And if you create an 8 gigabyte disk image
with "dd if=/dev/zero of=ubuntu-ppc.img bs=1M count=8192", you can tell
qemu to attach that image to the virtual /dev/hda with "-hda ubuntu-ppc.img".
You'll need to add "-boot d" to tell the emulated system's bios to boot from
the cdrom instead of the hard drive.)</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>QEMU is faster than most emulators because it uses dynamic recompliation,
meaning it translates entire pages and keeps the translated pages around
(sort of like a Java JIT compiler, or Transmeta's code morphing layer).
The translation overhead is similar to the pause fetching code from disk, or
the latency of copying DRAM into L2 cache.  It occurs exactly at the places
systems are already slow, and thus the places any modern software that cares
about performance is optimized to do as little as possible.</p>

<p>For example, on a 2ghz Pentium M laptop, a guest Knoppix identifies its
processor as a 600 mhz Pentium II.  While not a speed demon, this is fast
enough to play "frozen bubble" or conveniently regression test software builds
under <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/qemu">images of older Linux
versions</a>.  (Thanks to the emulated network card, fetching the software
to build is a simple wget.)</p>

<h2>System Emulation vs Native Emulation</h2>

<p>QEMU has two different ways of running software.  The above examples are
system emulation, which boots an entire "guest" operating system with a virtual
PCI bus and virtual devices attached.  The above example examples use system
emulation to boot and run a CDROM image on a virtual system with a virtual
CDROM drive.  The window shows the data the guest OS writes to the virtual
graphics card, and passes mouse and keyboard input back to the guest's virtual
mouse and keyboard devices.  QEMU also provides the guest with a virtual
network card (behind a virtual masquerading hub providing virtual dhcp and dns
service for its' subnet), and can configure virtual sound cards, USB devices,
and more from the command line.</p>

<p>QEMU's other mode, application emulation, runs a single program and
intercepts each system call, translating it to run on the host system.  Thus
if you happen to have a statically linked big endian arm version of busybox
lying around and want to try it out, "qemu-armeb busybox" should do the trick.
(Telling qemu's application emulation mode where to find the shared libraries
is a bit trickerfor dynamically linked apps is beyond the scope of this introduction.)</p>
