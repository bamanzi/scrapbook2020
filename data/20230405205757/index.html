<p>As a child, Bruce Wayne helplessly watched as his parents were brutally murdered in front of him. From that day forth, Bruce vowed to ensure that such a thing could never happen again. Spending years bettering himself, he returned a different man and donned the cape and cowl to become...Batman! The Caped Crusader! The Dark Knight! Created by Bill Finger with Bob Kane in 1939, the World's Greatest Detective has become a fixture in pop culture the world ever since.</p>

<p>These are the most highly recommended starting points, great for readers looking to get in at the ground level and be introduced to the Dark Knight's most essential qualities.  </p>
<h3 id="wiki_batman.3A_year_one">Batman: Year One</h3>
<p>Written by: Frank Miller<br>
Art by: David Mazzuchelli<br>
First Published: 1987  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his first year on the job, Batman feels his way around a Gotham City far darker than the one he left. His solemn vow to extinguish the town’s criminal element is only half the battle; along with Lieutenant James Gordon, the Dark Knight must also fight a police force more corrupt than the scum in the streets.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Year One</em> is the most widely accepted modern origin story, and has been used as a basis for numerous adaptations. It also provides a look at the state of Gotham before Batman arrived at the scene, and how James Gordon came to ally himself with the masked vigilante.  </p>

<h3 id="wiki_batman.3A_the_long_halloween_.2F_dark_victory">Batman: The Long Halloween / Dark Victory</h3>
<p>Written by: Jeph Loeb<br>
Art by: Tim Sale<br>
First Published: 1996  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working with District Attorney Harvey Dent and Lieutenant James Gordon, Batman races against the calendar as he tries to discover who the Holiday Killer is before he claims his next victim each month. A mystery that has the reader continually guessing the identity of the killer, this story also ties into the events that transform Harvey Dent into Batman's deadly enemy, Two-Face.  </p>
<p>In the sequel, Gotham City suddenly finds itself being run by lawless freaks, such as Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, and the Joker. It is still early in Batman's crimefighting career, but the Dark Knight is on the verge of completing his transformation into the city's greatest defender. However, nothing he has experienced thus far—not even a new sidekick named Robin—will prepare him for the Hangman.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pair of detective noir stories pit Batman against not just the Gotham mob families, but also against his extensive rogue gallery. <em>The Long Halloween</em> is particularly notable for telling the iconic story of Harvey Dent, while <em>Dark Victory</em> introduces Dick Grayson.  </p>

First Published: 2002  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gotham City’s worst criminals—Joker, Riddler, Ra’s al Ghul, Clayface and others—have emerged to throw Batman’s life into utter chaos. However, these villains are part of a much more elaborate, sinister scheme to destroy the Dark Knight once and for all, one headed by a mastermind much closer to Bruce Wayne than any foe before...</p>
<p>Pushed past his breaking point, Batman will need to use more than the world’s greatest detective skills to unravel the mystery behind this murderous plot before those closest to the Detective suffer the consequences.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From an all-star creative team, <em>Hush</em> is a detective story that more importantly introduces readers to the modern mythology of Batman, from his allies to his rogues to his romance with Catwoman. For more Hush, follow up with <em>Heart of Hush</em>, as seen below.    </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Beginning with the famous story "The Court of Owls" that introduces a brand new villain, Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo's run sets the stage for Batman's rebooted continuity in The New 52 era.    </p>

First Published: 1988  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the grinning engine of madness and mayhem known as The Joker, that's all that separates the sane from the psychotic. Freed once again from the confines of Arkham Asylum, he's out to prove his deranged point. And he's going to use Gotham City's top cop, Commissioner Jim Gordon, and his brilliant and beautiful daughter Barbara to do it.</p>
<p>Now Batman must race to stop his archnemesis before his reign of terror claims two of the Dark Knight's closest friends. Can he finally put an end to the cycle of bloodlust and lunacy that links these two iconic foes before it leads to its fatal conclusion? And as the horrifying origin of the Clown Prince of Crime is finally revealed, will the thin line that separates Batman's nobility and The Joker's insanity snap once and for all?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Killing Joke</em> is a very well-known (and controversial) story that attempts to dive into the psychology behind the Joker. This short story is best recommended for readers already familiar with the enmity between Batman and the Joker.</p>

But with the return of the vigilante, Batman, and the appearance of an enigmatic new Batgirl, justice returns to Gotham.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>No Man's Land</em> was a year-long status quo that changed Gotham radically. These volumes collect a number of connected story arcs that follow the ragtag Gotham policemen and vigilantes as they attempt to maintain order in a city left for dead, as various villains attempt to exploit it. Notable developments include the debut of Cassandra Cain, who would later become Batgirl, and a character arc for Helena Bertinelli, the Huntress. The <em>Cataclysm</em> and <em>Road to No Man's Land</em> trades collect the lead-up to the event, and are optional reading, though they do add a lot of useful context.   </p>

First Published: 1986  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is ten years after an aging Batman has retired, and Gotham City has sunk deeper into decadence and lawlessness. Now, when his city needs him most, the Dark Knight returns in a blaze of glory. Joined by Carrie Kelly, a teenage female Robin, Batman takes to the streets to end the threat of the mutant gangs that have overrun the city. And after facing off against his two greatest enemies, the Joker and Two-Face, for the final time Batman finds himself in mortal combat with his former ally, Superman, in a battle that only one of them will survive.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> is an iconic Batman story and one of most influential comic books ever written, as it redefines Batman as the tragic hero he is known as today.  </p>

<p>Bruce Wainwright, a comic book-reading kid obssessed with the Caped Crusader, loses his parents in a violent crime...and in the real world, no superheroes exist to save the day.</p>
<p>Batman: Creature of the Night, written by Kurt Busiek (Astro City) and drawn by John Paul Leon (Mother Panic) is a stand-alone story set outside of regular continuity in 1968 Boston, MA. The victim of the brutal murder of his family, young Bruce sees grief and rage build inside himself...until something strange starts taking wing in the Gotham night! Something similar to the comics he's been reading his whole life. As life begins to imitate art, will Bruce Wainwright be able to live up to his fictional namesake?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Creature of the Night</em> is a story starring a young boy who goes through the most traumatic experience that a child can go through. As he grows into a man, the tragedy lingers in the back of young Bruce Wainwright's mind, never going away, and influencing his life decisions. This isn't a story about a crusade for justice, or expensive gadgets. This is a story of how people can heal from trauma, and how things can go wrong.   </p>

<p>Bruce Wayne’s mission as the Batman has only been underway for a year or so, but he can tell he’s making a difference in this city. Unfortunately, he’s made some powerful enemies–and not just among the colorful maniacs called “super-villains.” All the traditional power brokers of Gotham resent the disruption the Batman has brought to town… and it seems one of them has a plan to neutralize him. There’s a second Batman haunting Gotham’s rooftops and alleys–and this one has no qualms about murdering criminals, live and on tape. With the entire might of the Gotham City Police Department and Gotham’s rich and powerful coming down on his head, Batman must find this imposter and somehow clear his name…but how can you prove your innocence from behind a mask?  </p>

<h2 id="wiki_grant_morrison.27s_batman_saga">Grant Morrison's Batman Saga</h2>
<p>Grant Morrison had touched on Batman multiple times in his 30+ year career in comics, from Gothic, to Arkham Asylum, to Batman's appearances in the 1990s JLA. But when he took over the Batman series in 2006, he set out to craft an epic that would build off the entire history of The Caped Crusader, stitching together one cohesive arc for the hero and his franchise from the beginnings of the Golden Age in 1939 to the modern day. Morrison's Batman was not just a caped crusader protecting Gotham; he was the product of all the the wild, weird and zany life experiences Batman had endured across all the various eras of comics history. Morrison united the disparate history of the character and wrote an epic that pushed the universe and the character forward, whilst strengthening and acknowledging all that come before. This is the tale where Batman meets his son, confronts his darkest failed mirrors, is threatened by the systemic destruction of Batman on a conceptual level, solves his final case, faces the god of depression and all evil and then is reborn for a new generation. This is where Dick Grayson becomes Batman, with Damian Wayne as his Robin. This is the birth of Batman Inc. The saga that would go onto form the spine for the Snyder run to come after and cement Batman as a figure of positive power, it is one that isn't to be missed. However this is a saga not recommended for brand new readers, as it requires at least a basic knowledge and grasp of Batman's colorful history.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, writer Paul Dini had a flourishing career penning the hugely popular Batman: The Animated Series and Tiny Toon Adventures. It was a golden era of television screenwriting, and Dini and his fellow writers were at the forefront of the glittering Hollywood scene. In one night, everything would change.</p>
<p>Walking home one evening, Dini was jumped and viciously beaten. With several broken bones and a shattered face, Dini experienced an arduous recovery process, hampered by the imagined antics of the villains he was writing for television, including the Joker, Harley Quinn, and the Penguin. But despite how bleak his circumstances were, or perhaps because of it, Dini also always imagined the Batman at his side, constantly chivvying him along during his darkest moments.</p>
<p>While most know the Caped Crusader as the all-abiding icon of justice and authority, in this surprising story, we see Batman in a new light—not as the dark avenger, but the savior who helped a discouraged man recover mentally from a brutal attack that left him unable to face the world.</p>

##Starting Points

These are the most highly recommended starting points, great for readers looking to get in at the ground level and be introduced to the Dark Knight's most essential qualities.  

###Batman: Year One
Written by: Frank Miller  
Art by: David Mazzuchelli  
First Published: 1987  

&gt;In his first year on the job, Batman feels his way around a Gotham City far darker than the one he left. His solemn vow to extinguish the town’s criminal element is only half the battle; along with Lieutenant James Gordon, the Dark Knight must also fight a police force more corrupt than the scum in the streets.  

*Year One* is the most widely accepted modern origin story, and has been used as a basis for numerous adaptations. It also provides a look at the state of Gotham before Batman arrived at the scene, and how James Gordon came to ally himself with the masked vigilante.  

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Year-One-Frank-Miller/dp/1401207529/)| [DC Universe Infinite](https://www.dcuniverseinfinite.com/collections/batman-year-one)

###Batman: The Long Halloween / Dark Victory
Written by: Jeph Loeb  
Art by: Tim Sale  
First Published: 1996  

&gt;Working with District Attorney Harvey Dent and Lieutenant James Gordon, Batman races against the calendar as he tries to discover who the Holiday Killer is before he claims his next victim each month. A mystery that has the reader continually guessing the identity of the killer, this story also ties into the events that transform Harvey Dent into Batman's deadly enemy, Two-Face.  

&gt;In the sequel, Gotham City suddenly finds itself being run by lawless freaks, such as Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, and the Joker. It is still early in Batman's crimefighting career, but the Dark Knight is on the verge of completing his transformation into the city's greatest defender. However, nothing he has experienced thus far—not even a new sidekick named Robin—will prepare him for the Hangman.  

This pair of detective noir stories pit Batman against not just the Gotham mob families, but also against his extensive rogue gallery. *The Long Halloween* is particularly notable for telling the iconic story of Harvey Dent, while *Dark Victory* introduces Dick Grayson.

###Batman: Hush
Written by: Jeph Loeb  
Art by: Jim Lee  
First Published: 2002  

&gt;Gotham City’s worst criminals—Joker, Riddler, Ra’s al Ghul, Clayface and others—have emerged to throw Batman’s life into utter chaos. However, these villains are part of a much more elaborate, sinister scheme to destroy the Dark Knight once and for all, one headed by a mastermind much closer to Bruce Wayne than any foe before...

&gt;Pushed past his breaking point, Batman will need to use more than the world’s greatest detective skills to unravel the mystery behind this murderous plot before those closest to the Detective suffer the consequences.  

From an all-star creative team, *Hush* is a detective story that more importantly introduces readers to the modern mythology of Batman, from his allies to his rogues to his romance with Catwoman. For more Hush, follow up with *Heart of Hush*, as seen below.

###Batman, by Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo
Written by: Scott Snyder  
Art by: Greg Capullo, et al.    
First Published: 2011  

&gt;After a series of brutal murders rocks Gotham City, Batman begins to realize that perhaps these crimes go far deeper than appearances suggest. As the Caped Crusader begins to unravel this deadly mystery, he discovers a conspiracy going back to his youth and beyond to the origins of the city he's sworn to protect.   

Beginning with the famous story "The Court of Owls" that introduces a brand new villain, Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo's run sets the stage for Batman's rebooted continuity in The New 52 era.

##Greatest Hits

These are highly acclaimed stories that dive a bit deeper into the Dark Knight's mythology, but are still fairly accessible and don't require much prior knowledge.  

###Batman: The Man Who Laughs
Written by: Ed Brubaker  
Art by: Doug Mahnke, Patrick Zircher    
First Published: 2005  

&gt;Witness Batman's first encounter with The Joker in this volume, by Ed Brubaker and Doug Mahnke! This collection also includes a murder mystery tale guest-starring Green Lantern Alan Scott.

###Batman: The Killing Joke
Written by: Alan Moore, Brian Bollard  
Art by: Brian Bollard  
First Published: 1988  

&gt;According to the grinning engine of madness and mayhem known as The Joker, that's all that separates the sane from the psychotic. Freed once again from the confines of Arkham Asylum, he's out to prove his deranged point. And he's going to use Gotham City's top cop, Commissioner Jim Gordon, and his brilliant and beautiful daughter Barbara to do it.

&gt;Now Batman must race to stop his archnemesis before his reign of terror claims two of the Dark Knight's closest friends. Can he finally put an end to the cycle of bloodlust and lunacy that links these two iconic foes before it leads to its fatal conclusion? And as the horrifying origin of the Clown Prince of Crime is finally revealed, will the thin line that separates Batman's nobility and The Joker's insanity snap once and for all?  

*The Killing Joke* is a very well-known (and controversial) story that attempts to dive into the psychology behind the Joker. This short story is best recommended for readers already familiar with the enmity between Batman and the Joker.

###Batman: Arkham Asylum - A Serious House on a Serious Earth

First Published: 1989  

&gt;The inmates of Arkham Asylum have taken over Gotham's detention center for the criminally insane on April Fool's Day, demanding Batman in exchange for their hostages. Accepting their demented challenge, Batman is forced to endure the personal hells of the Joker, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, Two-Face and many other sworn enemies in order to save the innocents and retake the prison. During his run through this absurd gauntlet, the Dark Knight's must face down both his most dangerous foes and his inner demons.  

*Arkham Asylum* presents a cerebral psychological take on Batman and his villains.

###Batman: No Man's Land
Written by: Scott Beatty, Chuck Dixon, Devin Grayson, Greg Rucka, Dennis O'Neil, John Ostrander, et al.  
Art by: various  
First Published: 1999

&gt;After suffering a cataclysmic earthquake, the U.S. government deemed Gotham City uninhabitable. Months later, those that refused to vacate "No Man's Land" live amidst a citywide war. But with the return of the vigilante, Batman, and the appearance of an enigmatic new Batgirl, justice returns to Gotham.  

*No Man's Land* was a year-long status quo that changed Gotham radically. These volumes collect a number of connected story arcs that follow the ragtag Gotham policemen and vigilantes as they attempt to maintain order in a city left for dead, as various villains attempt to exploit it. Notable developments include the debut of Cassandra Cain, who would later become Batgirl, and a character arc for Helena Bertinelli, the Huntress. The *Cataclysm* and *Road to No Man's Land* trades collect the lead-up to the event, and are optional reading, though they do add a lot of useful context.

###Batman: The Black Mirror
Written by: Scott Snyder  
Art by: Jock, Francesco Francavilla  
First Published: 2010  

&gt;In "The Black Mirror," a series of brutal murders pushes Batman's detective skills to the limit and forces him to confront one of Gotham City's oldest evils. Helpless and trapped in the deadly Mirror House, Batman must fight for his life against one of Gotham City's oldest and most powerful evils! Then, in a second story called "Hungry City," the corpse of a killer whale shows up on the floor of one of Gotham City's foremost banks. The event begins a strange and deadly mystery that will bring Batman face-to-face with the new, terrifying faces of organized crime in Gotham.  

This run, which vaulted Scott Snyder into superstardom, stars Dick Grayson as Batman, as he pits his optimism against a horrifying and seedy Gotham determined to break him down.

&gt; Batman: Creature of the Night, written by Kurt Busiek (Astro City) and drawn by John Paul Leon (Mother Panic) is a stand-alone story set outside of regular continuity in 1968 Boston, MA. The victim of the brutal murder of his family, young Bruce sees grief and rage build inside himself...until something strange starts taking wing in the Gotham night! Something similar to the comics he's been reading his whole life. As life begins to imitate art, will Bruce Wainwright be able to live up to his fictional namesake?  

*Creature of the Night* is a story starring a young boy who goes through the most traumatic experience that a child can go through. As he grows into a man, the tragedy lingers in the back of young Bruce Wainwright's mind, never going away, and influencing his life decisions. This isn't a story about a crusade for justice, or expensive gadgets. This is a story of how people can heal from trauma, and how things can go wrong.

&gt; Bruce Wayne’s mission as the Batman has only been underway for a year or so, but he can tell he’s making a difference in this city. Unfortunately, he’s made some powerful enemies–and not just among the colorful maniacs called “super-villains.” All the traditional power brokers of Gotham resent the disruption the Batman has brought to town… and it seems one of them has a plan to neutralize him. There’s a second Batman haunting Gotham’s rooftops and alleys–and this one has no qualms about murdering criminals, live and on tape. With the entire might of the Gotham City Police Department and Gotham’s rich and powerful coming down on his head, Batman must find this imposter and somehow clear his name…but how can you prove your innocence from behind a mask?

##Grant Morrison's Batman Saga

Grant Morrison had touched on Batman multiple times in his 30+ year career in comics, from Gothic, to Arkham Asylum, to Batman's appearances in the 1990s JLA. But when he took over the Batman series in 2006, he set out to craft an epic that would build off the entire history of The Caped Crusader, stitching together one cohesive arc for the hero and his franchise from the beginnings of the Golden Age in 1939 to the modern day. Morrison's Batman was not just a caped crusader protecting Gotham; he was the product of all the the wild, weird and zany life experiences Batman had endured across all the various eras of comics history. Morrison united the disparate history of the character and wrote an epic that pushed the universe and the character forward, whilst strengthening and acknowledging all that come before. This is the tale where Batman meets his son, confronts his darkest failed mirrors, is threatened by the systemic destruction of Batman on a conceptual level, solves his final case, faces the god of depression and all evil and then is reborn for a new generation. This is where Dick Grayson becomes Batman, with Damian Wayne as his Robin. This is the birth of Batman Inc. The saga that would go onto form the spine for the Snyder run to come after and cement Batman as a figure of positive power, it is one that isn't to be missed. However this is a saga not recommended for brand new readers, as it requires at least a basic knowledge and grasp of Batman's colorful history.

####**Dark Knight: A True Batman Story**, by Paul Dini and Eduardo Risso  

&gt; In the 1990s, writer Paul Dini had a flourishing career penning the hugely popular Batman: The Animated Series and Tiny Toon Adventures. It was a golden era of television screenwriting, and Dini and his fellow writers were at the forefront of the glittering Hollywood scene. In one night, everything would change.
&gt;  
&gt; Walking home one evening, Dini was jumped and viciously beaten. With several broken bones and a shattered face, Dini experienced an arduous recovery process, hampered by the imagined antics of the villains he was writing for television, including the Joker, Harley Quinn, and the Penguin. But despite how bleak his circumstances were, or perhaps because of it, Dini also always imagined the Batman at his side, constantly chivvying him along during his darkest moments.
&gt;  
&gt; While most know the Caped Crusader as the all-abiding icon of justice and authority, in this surprising story, we see Batman in a new light—not as the dark avenger, but the savior who helped a discouraged man recover mentally from a brutal attack that left him unable to face the world.
